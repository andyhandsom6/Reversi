# Reversi
This is a reversi game developed by a freshman of Yuanpei College, Peking University. 
It is the final project for the course Introduction to Computing A, in 2023 fall. 
The project is highlighted with practical functions such as repenting, file reading, etc..
You can also try PvE mode, in which I implemented an intellectual agent using min-max search algorithm. 

## Getting Started
I implemented the project using Chinese, so you can see that the project report and some file names are in Chinese. 

Source code is under the folder `黑白棋`，and in the file `源文件.cpp`. 

To start playing, run `黑白棋/x64/Debug/黑白棋.exe`. To edit source code, open `黑白棋/黑白棋.sln` with Visual Studio. 

Have fun!
